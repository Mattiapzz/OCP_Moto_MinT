# TO DO LIST

## Model

- Chain tension force as a control
  - use the torque of the motor or the force?
  - Inertia of shafts as an equivalent shaft?
- Check chain tension angle $\alpha_{crw}(t)$
  - Use it as an algebraic variable or as a constraint?
  - not sure of the position of the pinion wrt chassis
    - use fixed angle? 
    - use same angle as the swing arm? 
  
## Parameter computation

- Compute Static-State
  - Evaluate the internal DoF frozen
  - Evaluate CoM
  - Evaluate masses and inertias
- Compute Steady-State
  - SS in straight running as a minimisation problem
  - SS in static cornering situation
